        <h2>Yam and Black Bean Salad</h2>
<p>
<b>Preparation Time</b> 25 minutes<br />
<b>Cooking Time</b> 1 hour (for the yams)<br />
<b>Yield</b> 5 complete meals, or 10 side dishes.<br />
</p>
<p><b>Ingredients</b></p>
<p>
‚ùè 2 lbs. yams (about 3 medium), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes<br />
‚ùè 1/4 cup fresh lime juice<br />
‚ùè 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/4 for the dressing<br />
‚ùè 2 tsp. liquid honey<br />
‚ùè 1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced<br />
‚ùè 1 tsp. ground cumin<br />
‚ùè 1 tsp. chili powder<br />
‚ùè Hot sauce, to taste<br />
‚ùè 1 (19 oz.) can black beans, drained, rinsed, and drained again<br />
‚ùè 1/2 small red onion, finely diced<br />
‚ùè 2 medium bell peppers, finely diced<br />
‚ùè 1 cup frozen corn kernels OR substitute zucchini as desired<br />
‚ùè 1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro or sliced green onion<br />
‚ùè Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Method</b><br />
1. Cube the yams, add the corn, red onion, and anything else you want cooked and
bake in a large glass pan with a drizzle of olive oil. Bake for 30 minutes and then
stir the yams, add olive oil if they appear dried out. Then bake for another 30
minutes.<br />
2. In a very large bowl, prepare and add anything you do not want to be cooked.
Dice the bell peppers and the green onion or cilantro, rinse, drain and add the
black beans.<br />
3. Combine the lime juice, oil, honey, garlic, cumin, chilli powder and hot sauce in a
glass measuring cup and stir well.<br />
4. Add the yams and lime dressing to salad bowl and toss to combine. Refrigerate
until needed.<br />
5. Serve warm or cool.<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Recipe Options:</b> Make squash and black bean salad by replacing the yams with an
equal weight of cleaned banana squash, peeled and cubed. Chunks of cleaned banana
squash are available in the produce department. For a more distinct pepper taste,
instead of green bell pepper, use a fresh, mildly spiced poblano pepper in this recipe.

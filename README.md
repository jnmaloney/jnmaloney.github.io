## Recent Projects

### (2021) Gold Arcade

Visualisation software for interactive 3D virtual experiences. [https:\\goldarcade.github.io](https:\\goldarcade.github.io)

### (2019-2020) SolarSupplyAu: Visualising Daily Solar Supply

A project that was developed to visualise solar supply using current daily data. The visualisation displays solar supply down to regions of postcode size, the residential photovoltaic capacity, and the esimated daily supply of solar energy (with daily weather data).

Data is modelled based on real solar PV performance gathered from sites across Australia, and compared with daily weather grids for temperature and insolation (solar irradiance).

The SolarSupplyAu home page can be found at [https://jnmaloney.github.io/SolarSupplyAu/home.html](https://jnmaloney.github.io/SolarSupplyAu/home.html) or here [https://jnmaloney.github.io/SolarSupplyAu/docs/index.html](https://jnmaloney.github.io/SolarSupplyAu/docs/index.html).

The software is open source and free for non-commercial use. 

### (2018) WebGui

WebGui is a port of Dear IMGUI to the html5 web canvas, with WebAssembly binaries.

Bowen Hills

![](http://bur.st/~crooked/bowenhills001.jpg)

Real-time model of Bowen Hills AirPort Link project. All roads and buildings are accurate, as are sun and shadows. There is animated traffic to add realistic detail to the project. 

Surfers Paradise

![](http://bur.st/~crooked/GC%20Broadbeach.png)

Real-time simulation showing the Gold Coast as it would be with a new public transport system. The new system includes both trams and busways. The simulation contains many animations. Animated pedestrians walk the streets, the tram model includes working doors. You can even see passengers embarking the tram at each stop. 

Small Lot Code

![](http://bur.st/~crooked/Small%20Lot%20Code.png)

The Small Lot Code regulates the size and positioning of a structure to be built on a lot. The positioning is also dependent on any neighbouring structures. The Small Lot Code simulates interactively how a building could be placed by determinig the lot size and existing neighbours. 

Road Safety

![](http://bur.st/~crooked/RSA%20Tool.png)

Road Safety Audit (RSA) involves checking proposed road designs for adequate stopping distances and line-of-sight. A simulation was developed for testing proposed road designs in real-time 3d. This made sure that the proposal would satisfy RSA requirements.

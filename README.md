Recent Projects

(2019-2020) SolarSupplyAu: Visualising Daily Solar Supply

The project was developed to visualise daily solar supply using continually updating data. The visualisation displays solar supply down to regions of postcode size.

The SolarSupplyAu home page can be found at https://jnmaloney.github.io/SolarSupplyAu/home.html

(2018) WebGui

WebGui is a port of Dear IMGUI to the html5 web canvas, with WebAssembly binaries.

Bowen Hills

![](http://bur.st/~crooked/bowenhills001.jpg)

Real-time model of Bowen Hills AirPort Link project. All roads and buildings are accurate, as are sun and shadows. There is animated traffic to add realistic detail to the project. 

Surfers Paradise

![](http://bur.st/~crooked/GC%20Broadbeach.png)

Real-time simulation showing the Gold Coast as it would be with a new public transport system. The new system includes both trams and busways. The simulation contains many animations. Animated pedestrians walk the streets, the tram model includes working doors. You can even see passengers embarking the tram at each stop. 

Small Lot Code

![](http://bur.st/~crooked/Small%20Lot%20Code.png)

The Small Lot Code regulates the size and positioning of a structure to be built on a lot. The positioning is also dependent on any neighbouring structures. The Small Lot Code simulates interactively how a building could be placed by determinig the lot size and existing neighbours. 

Road Safety

![](http://bur.st/~crooked/RSA%20Tool.png)

Road Safety Audit (RSA) involves checking proposed road designs for adequate stopping distances and line-of-sight. A simulation was developed for testing proposed road designs in real-time 3d. This made sure that the proposal would satisfy RSA requirements.

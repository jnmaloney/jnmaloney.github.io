### (2019-2020) SolarSupplyAu: Visualising Daily Solar Supply

This project visualises solar supply using current data. The visualisation shows the solar supply to each postcode in every state and territory of Australia.

The data is gathered from the Bureau of Meteorology. The data is gathered for each day of the year. This data is used to estimate the daily solar supply to each region.

The visualisation shows the solar supply to each postcode. The solar supply is shown as a map and as a table. The solar supply is also shown as a bar chart.

A separate table shows the top postcodes in terms of total solar capacity.

The visualisation can be used to see how well solar energy is supplied at different times of the year.

Abstract

This project visualises solar supply using current data. Daily solar irradiance data is gathered from the Bureau of Meteorology. This data is then used to modelled the electricity generation of residential photovoltaic installations. Daily data is aggregated to postcode resolution to estimate the solar supply to each postcode. For each day, a detailed visualisation is presented including a map of the solar supply, a plot of the estimated residential solar capacity, and a plot of the supply by each postcode. The visualisation also includes a table that lists the top postcodes in terms of total solar capacity.



A project that was developed to visualise solar supply using current daily data. The visualisation displays solar supply down to regions of postcode size, the residential photovoltaic capacity, and the esimated daily supply of solar energy (with daily weather data).

Data is modelled based on real solar PV performance gathered from sites across Australia, and compared with daily weather grids for temperature and insolation (solar irradiance).

The SolarSupplyAu home page can be found at https://jnmaloney.github.io/SolarSupplyAu/home.html or here https://jnmaloney.github.io/SolarSupplyAu/docs/index.html.

The software is open source and free for non-commercial use. For information about using the software under a commercial licence please contact jnmaloney@gmail.com.

The visualisation is built using OpenGL and you can find the code for this project on GitHub at https://github.com/jnmaloney/SolarSupplyAu.

Credits

This project would not have been possible without the hard work of the following people:

This visualisation was developed by Joshua Maloney.

Many thanks to the Australian Photovoltaics Institute (APVI), who have provided much of the data on residential installation capacity. More information about the APVI can be found at www.apvi.org.au.

The climate data used in the visualisation is supplied by the Bureau of Meteorology.

The postcode boundaries used in this visualisation are provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

Bowen Hills

![](http://bur.st/~crooked/bowenhills001.jpg)

Real-time model of Bowen Hills AirPort Link project. All roads and buildings are accurate, as are sun and shadows. There is animated traffic to add realistic detail to the project. 

Surfers Paradise

![](http://bur.st/~crooked/GC%20Broadbeach.png)

Real-time simulation showing the Gold Coast as it would be with a new public transport system. The new system includes both trams and busways. The simulation contains many animations. Animated pedestrians walk the streets, the tram model includes working doors. You can even see passengers embarking the tram at each stop. 

Small Lot Code

![](http://bur.st/~crooked/Small%20Lot%20Code.png)

The Small Lot Code regulates the size and positioning of a structure to be built on a lot. The positioning is also dependent on any neighbouring structures. The Small Lot Code simulates interactively how a building could be placed by determinig the lot size and existing neighbours. 

Road Safety

![](http://bur.st/~crooked/RSA%20Tool.png)

Road Safety Audit (RSA) involves checking proposed road designs for adequate stopping distances and line-of-sight. A simulation was developed for testing proposed road designs in real-time 3d. This made sure that the proposal would satisfy RSA requirements.
